78,poorly construct hinge
79,think it over when you plan to own this one this sure is the last motor phone for me

85,it doesn't make you look cool
86,bought mainly for the charge which broke soon after purchasing
87,i put the latest o on it voter 15 and it now like to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
88,there's really nothing bad i can say about this head
89,we are sending it back
90,i came over from verie because circulating ha nicer cell phone the first thing i noticed wa the really bad service

114,you get what you pay for i guess
115,bad quality
116,it's not what it say it is
117,it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it look and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is

120,everything about this product is wrong first
121,it is cheap and it feel and look just a cheap
122,after receiving and using the product for just 2 day it broke
123,phone fall out easily
124,the first thing that happened wa that the tracking wa off
125,link should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurbished unit or something

140,invest also had problem with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again
141,piece of junk
142,the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and ha no front or side protection whatsoever
143,the battery is completely useless to me
144,the biggest complaint i have is the battery drain super
145,so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then rest it
146,bad purchase

150,improper description i had to return it
151,cant get the soft to work with my computer
152,i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form one anyway
153,reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end key are not where i expect them to be 3
154,the call drop the phone come on and off at will the screen go black and the worst of all it stop ringing intermittently
155,the commercial are the most misleading
156,steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacement pen which come in a three-part
157,i don't think it would hold it too securely on your belt
158,it make very strange ticking noise before it end the call
159,i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
160,piece of trash

162,then a few day later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use
163,then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
164,cumbersome design
165,all three broke within two month of use
166,one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side
167,while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now ha enough stress that it will break on the next drop

184,don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone
185,the construction of the head is poor
186,it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razor or with my previous wired head that plugged into an law
187,no additional ear gel provided and no instruction whatsoever
188,echo problem very unsatisfactory
189,these product cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
190,and none of the tone is acceptable
191,don't waste your money
192,this is infuriating
193,the loudspeaker option is great the bumper with the light is very appealing
194,it click into place in a way that make you wonder how long that mechanism would last
195,i found this product to be way too big
196,the instruction didn't explain that a microphone jacket could be used
197,uncomfortable in the ear don't use with law voter envy
198,you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
199,can't unload restoring from a third party
200,do not make the same mistake a me
201,i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
202,not worth it
203,you could only take 2 video at a time and the quality wa very poor
204,if you plan to use this in a car forget about it
205,i have 2-3 bar on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything
206,battery ha no life
207,the interne access wa fine it the rare instance that it worked

232,it last le than 31 minute if i actually try to use the phone my wife ha the same phone with the same problem
233,not what i wanted
234,who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery
235,battery last only a few hour
236,i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting
237,you need at least 3 min to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone battery life is short
238,they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
239,this phone might well be the worst invest ever had in any brand
240,all i can do is whine on the interne so here it go the more i use the thing the le i like it
241,avoid this one if you can
242,the text massaging feature is really tricky to use
243,the cable look so thin and flimsy it is scary

251,my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wife's phone wa almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it
252,they refuse to refund or replace
253,that's a huge design flaw unless investigation not using it correctly which i don't think is the case
254,the worst phone invest ever had only had it for a few month
255,the sound quality for the device is unacceptable unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
256,investigation trying to return it for a refund
257,i went on motor web and followed all direction but could not get it to pair again
258,the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leak out from the head
259,don't waste your money
260,last time buying from you
261,i would have given no star if i wa able
262,however the ear pad come off easily and after only one week i lost one

267,i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit wa still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i wa out of luck
268,very cheap plastic creak like an old wooden floor

278,reception is terrible and full of static
279,the plastic break really easy on this clip
280,however restoring are not the best and neither are the game
281,first of all it doesn't wear well
282,this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it look if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless
283,if there is a wind it is completely useless

298,i wouldn't recommend buying this product
299,if you have several dozen or several hundred contact then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one
300,worthless product
301,using all earliest left or right this thing will not stay on my ear
302,i ordered this for sonny esoteric which but i think it only worked once that when i first used it
303,if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere a the extra bell whistle are mediocre
304,if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversation then this phone is for you
305,it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk
306,if you don't find it too bad a again the unit come with one ear only i would not recommend this to anyone
307,low quality

323,when i placed my tree into the case not only wa it not snug but there wa a lot of extra room on the side
324,i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhorred it
325,unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle button if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
326,but now that it is out of warranty the same problem recur bottom line put your money somewhere else circulating will not support it
327,doe not work for listening to music with the circulating 81
328,the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
329,you need two hand to operate the screen this soft interface is decade old and cannot compete with new soft design

374,my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5 of 5

794,very happy with this product
795,these are certainly very comfortable and functional is decent
796,good product good seller
797,these are fabulous
798,so far it ha worked like a charm
799,nice head priced right
800,i wish i could enter negative value admit
801,the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actor period
802,the only real effect work is the presence of all the animal and the integration of those into the scene is some of the worst and most obvious blue green-scaled work invest ever seen
803,now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant all-American propaganda
804,graphic is far from the best part of the game
805,it's one of the most boring horror movie from the 90 mainly because it start slow and center in a boring atmosphere
806,again lame
807,glad i didn't pay to see it
808,but the premise of the film wa so ridiculous that the president of the u said
809,at around 4 pool-equipment i bought it at around 8 i started to watch at around 8 15 i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there wa anything left watch for a human being with a brain but there wasn't
810,exceptionally bad
811,but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film wa watched with a weird questioning glance
812,but she is still a bad actress repeating her robot face move in each of her picture
813,at no point in the proceeding doe it look remotely like all-American
814,but whatever it wa that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure
815,when i saw it in the theater i thought i wa going to be sick
816,it's a mediocre miserable hollow laugh and predictable piece of garbage
817,the very idea of it wa lame take a minor character from a mediocre pre-1960 film and make a complete non-service while changing it tone to a penetrated family movie
818,i cannot believe that the actor agreed to do this film
819,nobody identifies with these character because they're all cardboard cutout and stereotype or predictably revers
820,to call this movie a drama is ridiculous
821,my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain wa a low rent micelle iron
822,regrettably the film fails
823,this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly
824,to sum the film up breed is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebony virus
825,won what a bad film
826,bel lug wa totally extraneous into odd line
827,that movie wa bad
828,image rating only go a low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative number in there for case such a these
829,that wa done in the second movie
830,not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery
831,everything captain how say is either laugh or just plain stupid
832,in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all
833,wasted two hour
834,there are many continuity error one other user commented on different car in the garage judge's glass the one that got to me the most wa the fact judge's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene
835,every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kid pulling the plug wa a mercy killing for this horrible show
836,the script is homogeneously stupid
837,one of the most disappointing aspect is the lack of notable gorge
838,i felt a though her going to island did absolutely nothing whatsoever
839,all the pretty picture in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flaw at the core
840,there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place
841,final word this show is a real torture
842,lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing
843,the plot such a it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing
844,a truly truly bad film
845,the directing seems too pretentious
846,but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculous of it
847,summary the wittingly weren't witty
848,avoid at any and all cost
849,the movie lack visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underline the narrative
850,top line don't waste your time and money on this one it a bad a it come
851,i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
852,the football scene at the end were perplexing
853,it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life
854,delegate this film from your mind
855,avoid this film at all cost
856,the only thing worse than taxpayer's acting wa stock's singing
857,now this is a movie i really dislike
858,there are the usual hitch logic flaw
859,very bad performance play angel better a computer expert who is at home all the time
860,yes i am simplify thing here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problem with this film it ha too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation
861,even the squire look awful
862,the script is wa there a script
863,the character development also lacked in depth
864,utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture
865,this movie is bad
866,ironically i mostly find his film a total waste of time to watch
867,how awful she is
868,it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the character it wa simply annoying
869,the story is beyond stupid
870,the character were very stage and the storyline wa a lot like a stage farce
871,it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having job
872,i wa very disappointed in the movie
873,the visual effect were awful
874,all in all it an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money
875,end of day is one of the worst budget action movie invest ever seen
876,this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginals film i have ever seen in my entire life
877,1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10
878,the foreigner is not worth one second of your time
879,investigation translating movie for a living and this is the first movie in my 52-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence
880,not frightening in the least and barely comprehensive
881,it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason
882,the bimolecular of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a lui diaper commercial is completely unconvincing
883,there is no real plot
884,the story itself is just predictable and lazy
885,the set are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunder episode
886,there wa absolutely no warmth or charm to these scene or character
887,i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelf of the movie store it's not even a real movie
888,the dialogue is composed of thing that make little sense
889,a very very very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man
890,it is not good
891,the story were a unbelievable a the actor
892,you'd have to have the iniquity of particularly stupid mollify not to see that one coming
893,if it wa to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memory than i guess he succeeded
894,i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season
895,the concert sequence just sucked
896,also the story and acting were weak
897,everything about this movie is stupid
898,i literally vomiting while watching this film
899,full of unconvincing cardboard character it is blandly written by eastward chore who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean needle from whom one would expect a great deal more
900,if this premise sound stupid that's because it is
901,the fat computer goose wa unbelievable the bible thumped the bass girl who are these actor
902,the awful dialogue and hopeless overactive by everyone who get shot top off a real waste of space and time
903,but what really made it unchangeable wa the direction
904,the film look cheap and bland
905,i mean this in a terrible way
906,oh yeah and the storyline wa pathetic too
907,i wa bored throughout the whole damn thing
908,this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way
909,in a word it is embarrassing
910,in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in lost angel is nothing but nonsense
911,the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
912,i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way
913,and generally the line and plot is weaker than the average episode
914,i particularly remember my sens being assaulted by stride cord of music that would blared out with very little warning and even le meaning
915,victor muscleman wa even bad and brilliant don wa almost unrecognizable
916,these are the central theme of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotype and with no depth of imagination
917,it wa a good thing that the ticket only cost five dollar because i would be mad if it'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap
918,avoid at all cost
919,what on earth is iron doing in this film
920,whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me
921,i couldn't take them seriously
922,about 30 minute of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actor awkwardly bubbling overweight pseudo-symmetric gibbet corny enough to make a teen got blush almost always in older enlist and sometimes in lactating that may or may not be made up word
923,horrible
924,the directing is sloppy at best
925,there wa no chemistry between been aleck and sand bull in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly wa knocked out by
926,if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
927,and finally after all that we get to an ending that would been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerk fall
928,too politically correct
929,i wasn't expecting oxcart material but this
930,rating 0 10 grade zombie note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show
931,the jerky camera movement were also annoying
932,a bit predictable
933,very serious spoiled this movie wa a huge disappointment
934,crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teach you nothing if you already know racist and prejudice are bad thing
935,i wasn't the least bit interested
936,the fish is badly made and some of it underwater shot are repeated a thousand time in the film
937,i just got bored watching juice lange take her clothes off
938,from here on the wide character turn unintentionally comically
939,this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and wa very disappointed
940,the film lack any real scare or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit if to say the least i say that a an insulin dependent diabetic myself
941,highly unredeemed
942,let's start with all the problem the acting especially from the lead professor wa very very bad
943,it's an empty hollow shell of a movie
944,filming wa le expansive
945,investigation so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone
946,watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eye a much a this show
947,the story start too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest
948,investigation glad this pretentious piece of said didn't do a planned by the dodge stratum big shot it's gonna help movie maker who aren't in the very restrained movie business of quo
949,there wa nothing believable about it at all
950,i never walked out of a movie faster
951,he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screen of air force one who wa only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money
952,by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it
953,i know that jig orthicon wa very energetic and that nobody could be a much a him but gorge wa well dull
954,you can find better movie at youth
955,there is no plot or storyline
956,how this piece of trash wa ever released is beyond me the acting the story the character the supposedly special effect etc. it's all wrong
957,this is definitely one of the bad one
958,yeah the movie pretty much sucked
959,the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling
960,lewd black considerable talent is wasted here too a he is at his most incendiary when he is untrained which the pre-1960 rating certainly won't allow
961,never heard of any of them except cooled who wa totally unbelievable in the part
962,his co-star don't fare much better with people like morgen freeman journal hill and ed. helm just wasted
963,this one just fails to create any real suspense
964,unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict
965,this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minute of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 700 time
966,an hour and a half i wish i could bring back
967,considering the relation off screen between tailor and stand it wa surprising how little chemistry there wa on screen between the two of them
968,the acting is like watching wooden puppet moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is
969,one character is totally annoying with a voice that give me the feeling of fingernail on a charcoal
970,there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomiting
971,the explosion of the gas tank at the end wa just a awful
972,another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would sped forth soon after
973,it's a case of so bad it is laugh
974,this movie is so mending awful it couldn't have even been created
975,aside from it's terrible lead this film ha load of other debt
976,i can't believe there's even a sequel to this
977,so bad well it's just bad
978,this one want to surf on the small wave of space movie in 198 deep impact and aged and this one fails everywhere
979,only like 3 or 4 building used a couple of location maybe poor hum
980,the poor actor
981,then the film just dropped the ball
982,but even the talented care can't save this
983,i am not a film nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if it'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie
984,the least said about the acting the better
985,at any rate this film stink it not funny and full should have stayed with gallon and supernatural zombie movie
986,worse there's an incredibly weak sub thrown in that follows a little band of latter manifested a they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killing
987,i hate writing bad review about film especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it
988,even when the woman finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected thing happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep
989,hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing
990,it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscape that were a great part of the original
991,the only place good for this film is in the garbage
992,that's how it'd describe this painfully dreary time-cast of a film
993,the charge opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsomal sideshow for god sake
994,the lead man is charisma
995,thing happen character personality change plot twist occur for no real reason other than that script call for it
996,it will drive you barking mad
997,it is shameful
998,it's a shame to see good actor like thermometer and jam make a living in a mess like this
999,i thought it wa bad
1000,nothing new there
1001,i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad
1002,in fact this stink smell like a director release
1003,but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the hero didn't really work for their freedom
1004,first of all there are enough racial stereotype and racial joke to offend everyone
1005,i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minute just to get some relief
1006,he can bore you to piece and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else
1007,almost all of the song in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful
1008,there were too many close ups
1009,regardless the film fails on most level
1010,on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hour of life wasted in front of the screen
1011,you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them
1012,image big fan of rpm game too but this movie it a disgrace to any self-respect rigger there is
1013,the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overactive and underbracing
1014,this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here
1015,the plot wa the same a pretty much every other cheap horror
1016,i wa left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hour to fully recover
1017,the puppet look really cheese not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flick
1018,often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings
1019,the basic premise is wasted since it is sideline by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
1020,the acting wa bad the dialogue were extremely shallow and insincere
1021,it had some average acting from the main person and it wa a low budget a you clearly can see
1022,if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative
1023,this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie-goer public
1024,i hate movie like that
1025,he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he ha little to no charisma and terrible comedie timing
1026,even allowing for poor production value for the time 1971 and the format some kind of misery this is bad
1027,what the hell kind of crap is that
1028,i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribbled watched it before putting it on
1029,started watching this but didn't believe in any of the character
1030,the use of slow-moving needlessly repeat itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scene that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicle that looked like they were made from a corn flake box and a director style that bordered on stupidity
1031,it's very slow
1032,1 hour 54 minute of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking
1033,all in all a great disappointment
1034,the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rite hay is put up on a pedestal
1035,so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forget movie invest seen
1036,this wa one of the worst film i have ever seen
1037,very little music or anything to speak of
1038,the show would begin with smart as ed. comment to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
1039,which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review
1040,it wa too predictable even for a chick flick
1041,i know he wa a contract player with little control over his script but the acting wa a bad a the script
1042,it's like a bad two hour tva movie
1043,but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn
1044,both film are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it wa watch
1045,star trek voter the final frontier is the worst in the series
1046,again no plot at all
1047,i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie
1048,not recommended
1049,artless camera endlessly present u with the uglier setting imaginary i e
1050,trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those thing that make a movie watch like character story theme and so on
1051,a cheap and cheer heisted movie with poor characterization lot of underwrite style stoicism emotion think chow yuh fat in a better tomorrow and some cheese cliche thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judge roll a la john woo
1052,the film ha an ultra-fast look to it
1053,it just blew
1054,there aren't death scene like in previous movie and the f x are terrible
1055,i would see this movie again for free
1056,almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round
1057,none of them are engaging or exciting
1058,the movie wa so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peacemaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a column movie before
1059,of course the acting is blame
1060,lot of hole in the script
1061,it'll even say it again this is torture
1062,you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic line to speak but the director gave them no action
1063,the dialogue sucked
1064,very disappointing
1065,the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plant ha it right
1066,why wa this film made
1067,not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and genus but it also managed to give away the entire movie and investigation not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer
1068,this movie is terrible
1069,not recommended
1070,the flat re-enactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stag
1071,20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausibly uninitiated bore of a movie
1072,which ha more depth and character than the man underneath it
1073,i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie
1074,if you check the director's film on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance
1075,the movie is littered with overt racial slurped towards the black cast member and in return the white are depicted a moon and booboo
1076,don't waste your time
1077,the script look a if only a rough draft wa written and shooting began before a finished script wa completed
1078,what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in lost angel
1079,the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and it relation to the primary plot line is minifying
1080,i don't think invest ever gone to a movie and disliked it a much
1081,my rating just 3 out of 10
1082,deep spider just plain suck
1083,the attempt at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dose bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcanized stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhhu doe a belly dance to distract male guard
1084,there wa a few pathetic attempt to give the character some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot
1085,hated it
1086,the death row scene were entirely unmoved
1087,but this movie is definitely a below average rent
1088,so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumb thing you have never seen
1089,even bill booboo couldn't rise above the script which wa worse
1090,rating 1 out of 10
1091,it is indescribable the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen
1092,he really didn't seem to want to be hostile his voice were monotonous didn't get involved with the guest
1093,by the time the pyrometer waylaid the assistant i wa bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off
1094,this may be the only bad film he ever made
1095,with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer
1096,it wa forced like everything in this movie
1097,i don't think there are any redeeming quality in this remake
1098,in short this wa a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film
1099,worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh
1100,the plot well i said it'd let that one go
1101,everything about it is just bad
1102,nothing at all to recommend
1103,didn't laugh or even smile once
1104,really bad
1105,not easy to watch
1106,this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life
1107,a lass movie which should have been put to sleep forever
1108,so bad
1109,lot of hole in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 year between his childhood and mature age
1110,otherwise don't even waste your time on this
1111,but the acting even that of such professional a dragon and debt rock wa terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialogue childlike and the camera work barely tolerable
1112,unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad
1113,if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girl-friend boy-furiendo to keep you occupied through out
1114,his losing his marble so early in the proceeding is totally implausibly and unconvincing
1115,this wa a flick doomed from it conception
1116,i paid too much
1117,this is one of the worst sand bull movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad
1118,if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth a far a possible
1119,it wa a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i wa watching play rather than a film
1120,is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this
1121,investigation terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many award and accolade especially when there are far more deserving work of film out there
1122,the acting is terrible and the writing is worse
1123,i am so tired of cliche that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
1124,this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living working in a chilly abstruseness culture
1125,lame would be the best way to describe it
1126,it crackle with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meandered so badly
1127,i don't think invest ever seen a movie half a boring a this self-indulgence piece of junk
1128,today the graphic are crap
1129,the worst sapping dialogue i could go on and on
1130,the movie ha almost no action scene in it and very little comedy
1131,about half way through this film i started to dislike it
1132,director pause math who also wrote directed the weak 195 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his film
1133,seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on
1134,and the accent are absolutely abysmal
1135,now imagine that every single one of those decision wa made wrong
1136,sadder ha made a resume full of lousy amateurish film
1137,the performance are not improved by improvisation because the actor now have twice a much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good
1138,it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scene
1139,long whinny and pointless
1140,investigation not sure what he wa trying to do with this film
1141,omit watching this
1142,this is not money-making
1143,the dialogue is atrociously
1144,it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcase his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy
1145,to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of thing
1146,putting the race card aside let look at the major flaw in the film they destroy lattice character
1147,the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be a mysticism fodder
1148,the budget wa evidently very limited
1149,a for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening
1150,whatever the producer wa going for he missed entirely
1151,then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who false wa accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid
1152,overall this movie wa cheap trash
1153,invest seen soap opera more intelligent than this movie
1154,but it's just not funny
1155,i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing wa quite pathetic
1156,the malt setting are a dry and a barren a the dialogue
1157,i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniac
1158,won talk about awful
1159,all this movie doe is make you sick watching all these slack make excuse for their stupid action for 90 minute
1160,the story line is totally predictable
1161,your brain will attempt to shutdown a part of a primal impulse of self-preservation
1162,it wa so boring
1163,very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oxcart shortly
1164,there were several moment in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciating slow moving
1165,the plot ha more hole than a pair of fish stocking and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted
1166,but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movie
1167,the script is bad very bad it contains both chess and unmethodical joke that you normally see in rated r or nonce movie
1168,this would not even be good a a made for tva flick
1169,the chromatography it can be called tucked
1170,this scene is very strong and unpleasant
1171,speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchen
1172,hence the whole story lack a certain energy
1173,the script is a big flaw mess
1174,unless you're just out to visually collect all extant film of austere work you can skip this one
1175,character are one-time even the good guy and especially the bad guy
1176,it wa just too horrible
1177,the lighting is awful
1178,not sure who wa more lost the flat character or the audience nearly half of whom walked out
1179,even if you love bad movie do not watch this movie
1180,her line seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
1181,investigation still trying to get over how bad it wa
1182,camera again bad
1183,about ten minute into this film i started having second thought
1184,bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad
1185,and quite honestly often it not very good
1186,it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time
1187,there is a totally unnecessary train roller coasted scene
1188,the rest of the movie lack art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it work i guess because it's empty
1189,attempting artfulness with black white and clever camera angle the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous a the acting wa poor and the plot and line almost non-existent
1190,it is zorrillas time away from reality
1191,this show is made for all-American it is too stupid and full with hatred and cliche to be admitted elsewhere
1192,i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
1193,but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a meddle and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scene pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined a pretentious crap
1194,the movie seemed a little slow at first
1195,it wa housework
1196,the sound-truck sucked
1197,this wa a poor remake of my best friend wedding
1198,the result well are a shame
1199,everything stink
1200,it is an insane game
1201,now you know why i gave it a 10
1202,in other word the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other film
1203,punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema
1204,this is high adventure at it best
1205,okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so it'll give credit where credit due the creature effect were actually pretty cool
1206,if you do watch it however there are small consolation the actress playing anyone's sister each do a wonderful job with their role
1207,kiss kerosene is good in this movie and really make a difference
1208,the movie wa very interesting from beginning to the end
1209,everything from acting to chromatography wa solid
1210,the film's sole bright spot wa journal hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fan of the recent superb due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim
1211,go and see it
1212,i believe every one should see this movie a i think few people outside of south allegorical understand it past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process
1213,it feature an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nut
1214,i saw it a a child on tva back in 1970 when it wa the stranger and i loved it
1215,i rate this movie 9 10
1216,the best scene in the movie wa when garage is trying to find a song that keep running through his head
1217,i guess i liked the detail of his distinction he wa believable
1218,plus it wa well-braced and suited it relatively short run time
1219,yet i enjoy watching it
1220,it's one of the movie i need to see whenever it come on tva never mind the fact that i already have it memorized
1221,gotta love those close-up of slim drooping teeth
1222,my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robber ran portraying this type of man it wa a very good imitation of this type of individual and i wa impressed
1223,an instant classic with a great sound-truck and a catchy song during the ending credit
1224,mark my word this is one of those cult film like evil dead 2 or phantasy that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 year down the line
1225,i saw this film over christened and what a great film it wa
1226,if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirt joblessness rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplift ending give this one a try
1227,still it wa the set that got a big 10 on my over scale
1228,funny clever hip just like pray previous film hyped-up
1229,this is the kind of money that is wasted properly
1230,the camera really like her in this movie
1231,it's hard not to fall head-on in love with that girl
1232,the suspense builder were good just cross the line from g to primary
1233,predictable but not a bad watch
1234,the result is a power achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretation of fame
1235,the movie is not completely perfect but titter di glamorous will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie
1236,i struggle to find anything bad to say about it
1237,the writer germane beard undoubtedly did his housework because all reference are industry and character appropriate
1238,hopefully the director jam con can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win u over with a whole new film
1239,the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night
1240,this movie wa kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it
1241,despite the pan of reviewer i liked this movie
1242,however pause sadder ha indeed made a film about mishap that is both superb complex
1243,but in term of the writing it's very fresh and bold
1244,but it is entertaining nonetheless
1245,stevedore martini delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged upper class upright white guy
1246,the cast of veteran actor are more than just a nostalgia trip
1247,how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this
1248,totally different with load of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it
1249,if there wa ever a movie that needed worn-out to promote this is it
1250,you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the star
1251,the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentary invest seen
1252,lovely little thriller from hitch with lot of nice shenanigan surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxi
1253,the thing that the four kid get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch

1605,the chicken wing contained the dry chicken meat i have ever eaten
1606,the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a dour indoor garden for tea and biscuit
1607,i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
1608,we sat another ten minute and finally gave up and left
1609,any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one

1642,we'll never go again
1643,over rated

1645,then a if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
1646,for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i wa wildly disappointed
1647,but then they came back cold
1648,the live music on frigid totally blow

1652,before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this wa my third time eating at brachii burgeoned before writing a review
1653,we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the service we received from this restaurant
1654,i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who wa doing shot of firebug behind the bar
1655,the buffet at bell wa far from what i anticipated
1656,i just wanted to leave
1657,she ordered a toasted enlist muffin that came out unassisted
1658,we won't be going back anytime soon
1659,invest never been treated so bad
1660,anyways the food wa definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more
1661,investigation not eating here
1662,i ordered almond soup which wa just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meal
1663,the burgeoned had absolutely no flavor the meat itself wa totally bland the burgeoned wa overcooked and there wa no charcoal flavor
1664,by this point my friend and i had basically figured out this place wa a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known
1665,there is really nothing for me at post hope your experience is better
1666,i give it 2 thumb down
1667,hell no will i go back
1668,i had high hope for this place since the burner are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat
1669,for service i give them no star
1670,the staff are now not a friendly the wait time for being served are horrible no one even say his for the first 10 minute
1671,we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but wa quickly disappointed
1672,gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore
1673,ordered burgeoned rare came in we'll done
1674,this is wa due to the fact that it took 20 minute to be acknowledged then another 35 minute to get our food and they kept forgetting thing
1675,i wa very disappointed
1676,we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredient were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste
1677,i can take a little bad service but the food suck

1683,the cashew cream sauce wa bland and the vegetable were undertook
1684,i will not be eating there again
1685,there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again
1686,now the burner aren't a good the pizza which used to be amazing is dough and flavor
1687,just don't know why they were so slow
1688,your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me

1700,very tough and very short on flavor
1701,the warm beer didn't help
1702,friend's past also bad he barely touched it
1703,invest had better baggage from the grocery store
1704,this is a disgrace
1705,the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some car in your stomach
1706,soggy and not good
1707,by this time our side of the restaurant wa almost empty so there wa no excuse
1708,i asked multiple time for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself
1709,i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this wa certainly bad food
1710,we've tried to like this place but after 10 time i think we're done with them
1711,i can't tell you how disappointed i wa
1712,weird vibe from owner
1713,will not be back
1714,disappointing experience
1715,now i am getting angry and i want my damn phone
1716,the service wa not up to par either
1717,the sang wa about half of a glass wine full and wa 12 ridiculous
1718,there is nothing authentic about this place
1719,eel this location need a complete overhaul
1720,i started this review with two star but investigation editing it to give it only one
1721,on three different occasion i asked for well done or medium well and all three time i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
1722,hot dish are not hot cold dish are close to room tempo i watched staff prepare food with bare hand no glove everything is deep fried in oil
1723,do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish
1724,if you look for authentic that food go else where
1725,i hate those thing a much a cheap quality black olive
1726,but now i wa completely gross out
1727,i hate to disagree with my fellow yelped but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place
1728,we waited for thirty minute to be seated although there were 8 vacant table and we were the only folk waiting
1729,too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place
1730,the heart attack grill in downtown vinegar is an absolutely flat-bed excuse for a restaurant
1731,the burr blame
1732,the potato were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer
1733,the service here leaf a lot to be desired
1734,this place is horrible and way overpriced
1735,perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other review but investigation not inspired to go back
1736,it wa a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
1737,the pan cake everyone are raving about taste like a sugar disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old
1738,why are these sad little vegetable so overcooked
1739,it wa not good
1740,no one at the table thought the food wa above average or worth the wait that we had for it
1741,this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant
1742,it wa a huge awkward 1 50 piece of cow that wa 3 4th grist and fat
1743,i wa disgusted because i wa pretty sure that wa human hair
1744,the service wa terrible though
1745,service wa slow and not attentive
1746,my brother in law who work at the mall ate here same day and guess what he wa sick all night too
1747,the potato chip order wa sad i could probably count how many chip were in that box and it wa probably around 12
1748,the kid play area is nasty
1749,probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it
1750,not tasty and the texture wa just nasty
1751,i vomiting in the bathroom mid lunch
1752,if there were zero star i would give it zero star
1753,do not waste your money here
1754,like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again
1755,seafood wa limited to boiled shrimp and crab leg but the crab leg definitely did not taste fresh
1756,boy wa that sucker dry
1757,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating
1758,i checked out this place a couple year ago and wa not impressed
1759,this place deserves no star
1760,on the ground right next to our table wa a large smeared better-than-average pile of green bird pop
1761,worst food service invest had in a while
1762,we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either
1763,it wa equally awful
1764,after all the ravenous review i couldn't wait to eat here what a disappointment
1765,ordered a double cheese got a single patted that wa falling apart picture unloaded yeah still suck
1766,a lady at the table next to u found a live green caterpillar in her salad
1767,waited 2 hour never got either of our pizza a many other around u who came in later did
1768,it wa attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign
1769,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides cost
1770,i probably won't be coming back here
1771,terrible management
1772,seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
1773,my gyro wa basically letter only
1774,i have watched their price inflate portion get smaller and management attitude grow rapidly
1775,ordered an appetizing and took 40 minute and then the pizza another 10 minute
1776,i took back my money and got outta there
1777,waiter wa a jerk
1778,i wasn't really impressed with strip steak
1779,it wa extremely crumbly and pretty tasteless
1780,then our food came out disappointment ensued
1781,frozen puckish of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register
1782,poor service the waiter made me feel like i wa stupid every time he came to the table
1783,also the frieze are without a doubt the worst frieze invest ever had
1784,worst service to boot but that is the least of their worry
1785,invest lived here since 1970 and this wa the first and last time invest stepped foot into this place
1786,pricing is a bit of a concern at mellowed mushroom
1787,i find wasting food to be desirable but this just wasn't food
1788,i got home to see the dry damn wing ever
1789,i would not recommend this place
1790,the frieze were not hot and neither wa my burgeoned
1791,if you are reading this please don't go there
1792,the chicken dish are ok the beef is like shoe leather
1793,not even a hello we will be right with you
1794,first time there and might just be the last
1795,appetite instantly gone
1796,the service here is fair at best
1797,this place is overpriced not consistent with their booboo and it really is overpriced
1798,it wa so bad i had lost the heart to finish it
1799,i had about two bite and refused to eat anymore
1800,won't ever go here again
1801,the last 3 time i had lunch here ha been bad
1802,the service wa poor and that being nice
1803,this place should honestly be blown up
1804,the service wa me
1805,the cash had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being way overpriced
1806,i waited and waited
1807,the fried rice wa dry a well
1808,this place deserves one star and 90 ha to do with the food
1809,we ordered some old classic and some new dish after going there a few time and were sorely disappointed with everything
1810,my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service
1811,at least 40 passed in between u ordering and the food arriving and it wasn't that busy
1812,this place is disgusting
1813,we started with the tune sash which wa brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh
1814,sadly gone ram steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vinegar
1815,will never ever go back
1816,i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chip when it's so terrible
1817,must have been an off night at this place
1818,the chip ranch dipping sausage wa tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat
1819,strike 2 who want to be rushed
1820,i have been to very few place to eat that under no circumstance would i ever return to and this top the list
1821,they dropped more than the ball
1822,i came back today since they related and still not impressed
1823,the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever
1824,the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on u
1825,worst martini ever
1826,never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again
1827,overall i don't think that i would take my parent to this place again because they made most of the similar complaint that i silently felt too
1828,there is nothing privileged about working eating there
1829,which are small and not worth the price
1830,avoid this establishment
1831,bland not a liking this place for a number of reason and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing it'll leave it at that
1832,and the bean and rice were mediocre at best
1833,after waiting an hour and being seated i wa not in the greatest of mood
1834,we aren't one to make a scene at restaurant but i just don't get it definitely lost the love after this one
1835,definitely not worth the 3 i paid
1836,i guess maybe we went on an off night but it wa disgraceful
1837,for about 10 minute we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon
1838,not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed
1839,probably not in a hurry to go back
1840,it wa probably dirt
1841,waited and waited and waited
1842,the serve wa very negligent of our need and made u feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place
1843,terrible service
1844,i wouldn't return
1845,best of luck to the rude and non-com service focused new management
1846,i don't think it'll be running back to car's anytime soon for food
1847,it's too bad the food is so damn genus
1848,this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food
1849,not good by any stretch of the imagination
1850,the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see
1851,in summary this wa a largely disappointing dining experience
1852,very slow at seating even with reservation
1853,not much seafood and like 5 string of past at the bottom
1854,the burgeoned i got the gold standard a 17 burgeoned and wa kind of disappointed
1855,the worst experience ever
1856,we could not believe how dirty the oyster were
1857,she wa quite disappointed although some blame need to be placed at her door
1858,it wa packed
1859,i do love sushi but i found killable to be overpriced over and undeserved
1860,if she had not rolled the eye we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again
1861,the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tender very unsatisfactory
1862,real sushi lover let's be honest ya is not that good
1863,i swung in to give them a try but wa deeply disappointed
1864,definitely a turn off for me i doubt it'll be back unless someone else is buying
1865,we will not be coming back
1866,we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minute just to place our order another 30 minute before the food arrived
1867,my girl-friend veal wa very bad
1868,investigation probably one of the few people to ever go to insane and not like it
1869,mediocre food
1870,we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guest a well
1871,way over rated is all i am saying
1872,hard to judge whether these side were good because we were gross out by the melted styrene and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick
1873,the table outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the worker are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
1874,my friend did not like his bloody marry
1875,the service wa a bit lacking
1876,a drive thru mean you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make u wait and wait
1877,similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food wa 45 minute late
1878,we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other table and ignore u
1879,i just don't know how this place managed to served the bland food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indignant cuisine
1880,we won't be going back
1881,he wa extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurant i would love to dine at during a weekend in vinegar
1882,we waited an hour for what wa a breakfast i could have done 100 time better at home
1883,the service wa terrible food wa mediocre
1884,don't bother coming here
1885,unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on left day because everything we ordered wa stale
1886,third the cheese on my friend's burgeoned wa cold
1887,the food wa barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the serve to bring it out to u
1888,the serve went back and forth several time not even so much a an are you being helped
1889,the serve are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupon
1890,based on the subpart service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back
1891,the worst wa the salmon sash
1892,would not recommend to others
1893,don't do it
1894,it sure doe beat the natch at the movie but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant
1895,investigation not sure how long we stood there but it wa long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place
1896,what did bother me wa the slow service
1897,i felt insulted and disrespect how could you talk and judge another human being like that
1898,i wa shocked because no sign indicate cash only
1899,not my thing
1900,this place lacked style
1901,i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day
1902,service suck
1903,i had the chicken phone and it tasted very bland
1904,nothing special
1905,the refreshed bean that came with my meal were dried out and crust and the food wa bland
1906,the chain which investigation no fan of beat this place easily
1907,for 40 buck a head i really expect better food
1908,overpriced for what you are getting
1909,spend your money and time some place else
1910,i probably won't be back to be honest
1911,it'll take my business dinner dollar elsewhere
1912,the presentation of the food wa awful
1913,first the bathroom at this location were dirty seat cover were not replenished just plain yucca
1914,overall i wa very disappointed with the quality of food at bourbon
1915,i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mileage
1916,tasted like dirt
1917,hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in
1918,i go to far too many place and invest never seen any restaurant that serf a 1 egg breakfast especially for 4 0600
1919,it kept getting worse and worse so now investigation officially done
1920,i don't think we'll be going back anytime soon
1921,i would not recommend this place
1922,my fella got the hue rancher and they didn't look too appealing
1923,shrimp when i upped it i live only 1 2 a mile from brushfire it wa literally ice cold
1924,total waste of time
1925,i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the ex-liberals but i didn't use my common sense
1926,i will not return
1927,however there wa so much garlic in the fond it wa barely edible
1928,worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of me bunch of horrible name calling
1929,it wa pretty gross
1930,sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon
1931,although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience wa a bit disappointing
1932,the place wa fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it
1933,very poor service
1934,the management is rude
1935,paying 7 85 for a hot dog and frieze that look like it came out of a kid's meal at the wiener is not my idea of a good meal
1936,bland and flavor is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
1937,i have been in more than a few bar in vinegar and do not ever recall being charged for tap water
1938,main thing i didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30 and up
1939,the chip that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible
1940,i won't be back
1941,the real disappointment wa our waiter
1942,i wa so insulted
1943,what happened next wa pretty off putting
1944,service stink here
1945,tonight i had the elk filet special and it sucked
1946,the bus boy on the other hand wa so rude
1947,i probably would not go here again
1948,the rid style camaraderie wa a joke
1949,if someone order two tact don't you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart
1950,my order wa not correct
1951,the pizza tasted old super chew in not a good way
1952,food is way overpriced and portion are fuck small
1953,the ripped banana wa not only ripped but petrified and tasteless
1954,it wasn't busy at all and now we know why
1955,and the red curry had so much boo shot and wasn't very tasty to me
1956,i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it wa a business lunch
1957,furthermore you can't even find hour of operation on the web
1958,i dressed up to be treated so rudely
1959,i consider this theft
1960,investigation not impressed with the concept or the food
1961,rifleman's bar is definitely one editing establishment i won't be revising
1962,don't waste your time here
1963,despite how hard i rate business it actually rare for me to give a 1 star
1964,i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she wa on the verge of having a heart attack
1965,rude inconsiderable management
1966,the meat wa pretty dry i had the sliced brisker and pulled pork
1967,after two i felt disgusting
1968,food wa below average
1969,very very sad
1970,con spotty service
1971,needle to say i won't be going back anytime soon
1972,will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened
1973,it wasn't busy either also the building wa freezing cold
1974,tried to go here for lunch and it wa a madhouse
1975,the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow
1976,overall i wa not impressed and would not go back
1977,for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone
1978,so don't go there if you are looking for good food
1979,the ambiance isn't much better
1980,the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friend really did not enjoy their meal either
1981,bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dish otherwise
1982,i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spice and flavor
1983,i wa modified
1984,the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined
1985,after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert
1986,not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served u our food
1987,del tact is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
1988,we waited for forty five minute in vain
1989,investigation super piss
1990,and the drink are weak people
1991,i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough
