0,oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone
1,that one didn't work either
2,waste of 13 bucks
3,product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellophane i was planning to use it with
4,none of the three sizes they sent with the heads would stay in my ears
5,worst customer service
6,the nagged is still lacking in ear
7,it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed
8,the only very disappointing thing was there was no speaker
9,very disappointed in accessory
10,basically the service was very bad
11,bad choice
12,the only thing that disappointing me is the infra red port ire
13,horrible had to switch 3 times
14,it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them
15,don't make the same mistake i did
16,muddy low quality sound and the casino around the wire insert was poorly super glued and slid off
17,i advise everyone do not be fooled
18,doesn't hold charge
19,what a waste of time
20,investigation very disappointed with my decision
21,i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use
22,i bought these hoping i could make my blue heads fit better but these things made it impossible to wear
23,we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros
24,also difficult to put on it'd recommend avoiding this product
25,50 down the drain
26,absolutely junk
27,can't store anything but phone numbers to simple
28,very disappointing
29,i would not recommend this item to anyone
30,big disappointment with calendar synce
31,not impressed
32,just does not work
33,i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and win and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning
34,plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
35,in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
36,the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally
37,very unreliable service from two-mile
38,down the drain because of a weak snap
39,this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptable
40,pretty piece of junk
41,this is so embarrassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear
42,unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect
43,this is the first phone invest had that has been so cheaply made
44,awkward to use and unreliable
45,horrible phone
46,if you are looking for a good quality motor heads keep looking this isn't it
47,my father has the voters and the battery is dying
48,after a year the battery went completely dead on my heads
49,defective crap
50,poor construction
51,they work about 2 weeks then break
52,could not get strong enough signal
53,i really wanted the plant 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for me the good
54,excellent starter wires heads
55,performed awful muffled tiny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
56,been battery junk
57,the design might be economic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear
58,camera color balance is awful
59,it ditty not work most of the time with my nooks 532
60,looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment
61,invest had this blue heads for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear
62,plug was the wrong size
63,the phone was usable and was not new
64,if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beep letting me know its dining
65,it's so stupid to have to keep buying new charge car charge cradles headstones and car kits every time a new phone comes out
66,poor quality and service
67,poor product
68,investigation a bit disappointed
69,i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great
70,there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before
71,the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all
72,at first i thought i was getting a good deal at 7 44 until i plugged it into my phone voters razor
73,don buy it
74,so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converted
75,soy technology suck
76,doesn't last long
77,still waiting investigation sure this item would work well if i ever relieve it
78,poorly construct hinge
79,think it over when you plan to own this one this sure is the last motor phone for me
80,problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily
81,the bottom line another worthless cheap gimme from sprinted
82,this pair of headstones is the worst that i have ever had sound
83,att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
84,i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
85,it doesn't make you look cool
86,bought mainly for the charge which broke soon after purchasing
87,i put the latest os on it voters 15 and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
88,there's really nothing bad i can say about this heads
89,we are sending it back
90,i came over from verie because circulating has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service
91,unreliable investigation giving up
92,after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part
93,it was a waste of my money
94,don't waste your money and time
95,due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this heads
96,i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing
97,does not fit
98,it'll be looking for a new eyepiece
99,however the key are so tiny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons
100,unfortunately it did not work
101,couldn't figure it out
102,worst soft ever used if i could give this zero stars i would
103,lousy product
104,lasted one day and then blew up
105,i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery
106,i was not impressed by this product
107,not enough volume
108,buyer be very careful
109,were jerks on the phone
110,but when i check voice mail at night the key back-lighted turns off a few seconds into the first message and then investigation lost
111,disappointing results
112,i got the car charge and not even after a week the charge was broken i went to plug it in and it started smoking
113,i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers
114,you get what you pay for i guess
115,bad quality
116,it's not what it says it is
117,it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is
118,all in all it'd expected a better consumer experience from motor
119,sending it back
120,everything about this product is wrong first
121,it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
122,after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke
123,phone falls out easily
124,the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
125,links should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurbished unit or something
126,a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
127,the been heads was such a disappointment
128,i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great
129,what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone
130,doesn't work at all i bough it for my laws and its not working
131,very disappointed
132,ear piece breaks easily
133,i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what
134,it doesn't work in eloped or aside
135,i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately
136,investigation really disappointed all i have now is a charge that doesn't work
137,horrible horrible protect
138,rip off over charge shipping
139,case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear
140,invest also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again
141,piece of junk
142,the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever
143,the battery is completely useless to me
144,the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains super
145,so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then rest it
146,bad purchase
147,it was horrible
148,perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this
149,not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it
150,improper description i had to return it
151,cant get the soft to work with my computer
152,i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form one anyway
153,reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be 3
154,the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently
155,the commercials are the most misleading
156,steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacement pens which come in a three-part
157,i don't think it would hold it too securely on your belt
158,it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call
159,i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
160,piece of trash
161,not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player
162,then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use
163,then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
164,cumbersome design
165,all three broke within two months of use
166,one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side
167,while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop
168,the camera although rated at an impressive 1 3 megaton renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution
169,the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face
170,item does not match picture
171,do not buy do not buy suck
172,doesn't work
173,sprinted charges for this service
174,i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
175,this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate
176,stay away from this store be careful
177,it's a piece of crap
178,sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
179,adapter does not provide enough charging current
180,talk about useless customer service
181,what a big waste of time
182,tied to charge for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes major problems
183,you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lenses is covered
184,don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone
185,the construction of the heads is poor
186,it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razor or with my previous wired heads that plugged into an laws
187,no additional ear gel provided and no instructions whatsoever
188,echo problem very unsatisfactory
189,these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
190,and none of the tones is acceptable
191,don't waste your money
192,this is infuriating
193,the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing
194,it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last
195,i found this product to be way too big
196,the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jacket could be used
197,uncomfortable in the ear don't use with laws voters envy
198,you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
199,can't unload restoring from a third party
200,do not make the same mistake as me
201,i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
202,not worth it
203,you could only take 2 video at a time and the quality was very poor
204,if you plan to use this in a car forget about it
205,i have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything
206,battery has no life
207,the interne access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
208,shaggy floppy piece of junk
209,wont work right or apostle for me
210,don't waste your on this one
211,audio quality is poor very poor
212,invest missed numerous calls because of this reason
213,the item received was counterfeit
214,this product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
215,first off the reception suck i have never had more than 2 bars ever
216,don't bother go to the store
217,very disappointed
218,kind of flops around
219,the pleats case doesn't fit
220,no real improvement
221,truly awful
222,invest bought 5 wired headstones that sound better than these
223,as an earlier review noted plug in this charge and nothing happens
224,after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes
225,i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap
226,disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear
227,warning stay away
228,very disappointing performance
229,do not buy if you want to use the holster
230,veteran's bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple
231,chines forgeries abound
232,it lasts less than 31 minutes if i actually try to use the phone my wife has the same phone with the same problem
233,not what i wanted
234,who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery
235,battery lasts only a few hours
236,i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting
237,you need at least 3 min to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone battery life is short
238,they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
239,this phone might well be the worst invest ever had in any brand
240,all i can do is whine on the interne so here it goes the more i use the thing the less i like it
241,avoid this one if you can
242,the text massaging feature is really tricky to use
243,the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary
244,i received my supposedly new motor 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charge
245,obviously there is a problem with the adhesive
246,the volume switch rocket out of the unit to a destination unknown
247,even in my been 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying
248,this product is very high quality chines crap
249,verie teach support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re-set wiping out all my data
250,we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hours original used to last a week but still lasts longer than there
251,my phone sounded oks not great oks but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it
252,they refuse to refund or replace
253,that's a huge design flaw unless investigation not using it correctly which i don't think is the case
254,the worst phone invest ever had only had it for a few months
255,the sound quality for the device is unacceptable unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
256,investigation trying to return it for a refund
257,i went on motor web and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again
258,the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the heads
259,don't waste your money
260,last time buying from you
261,i would have given no star if i was able
262,however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one
263,however i needed some better instructions
264,i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone
265,after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden
266,it is usable in a moving car at freeway speed
267,i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck
268,very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor
269,the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
270,don waste your money
271,in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic
272,i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the heads lost signal
273,i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected
274,what a waste of money and time
275,i only hear garbage for audio
276,the replacement died in a few weeks
277,the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
278,reception is terrible and full of static
279,the plastic breaks really easy on this clip
280,however restoring are not the best and neither are the games
281,first of all it doesn't wear well
282,this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless
283,if there is a wind it is completely useless
284,interne is excruciating slow
285,bad fit way too big
286,blue does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked
287,waste of money
288,it didn't charge for me
289,sprinted terrible customer service
290,people could hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphones and talk on the phone
291,design flaw
292,the nooks can us cable did not work with my phone
293,the battery runs down quickly
294,my 52-year old nooks 216 from track holds the charge a lot better than this
295,useless phone simply deaf
296,battery life still not long enough in motor razor voters
297,the battery life is highly unacceptable
298,i wouldn't recommend buying this product
299,if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one
300,worthless product
301,using all earliest left or right this thing will not stay on my ear
302,i ordered this for sonny esoteric which but i think it only worked once that when i first used it
303,if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistle are mediocre
304,if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
305,it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk
306,if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one ear only i would not recommend this to anyone
307,low quality
308,a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days
309,how stupid is that
310,it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality
311,does not charge the circulating att 85 phone
312,i have to jiggling the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume
313,so just beware
314,i cannot make calls at certain places
315,not good enough for the price
316,i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product
317,terrible product and waste of money
318,disappointing
319,the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antenna
320,i was not happy with this item
321,bad reception
322,i give wire 1 star i will contact circulating at t and inform them of this practice
323,when i placed my tree into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides
324,i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhorred it
325,unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
326,but now that it is out of warranty the same problems recur bottom line put your money somewhere else circulating will not support it
327,does not work for listening to music with the circulating 81
328,the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
329,you need two hands to operate the screen this soft interface is decade old and cannot compete with new soft designs
330,so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing
331,warning do not buy
332,worst ever
333,disappointed
334,it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazons
335,painful on the ear
336,investigation returning them
337,very displeased
338,the instruction manual is lacking
339,voice quality signal strength dropped calls
340,the phone gets extremely hot
341,used and dirty
342,the majority of the logic ear heads failed
343,it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charge
344,don't trust their web and don't expect any helpful support
345,i had to purchase a different case
346,i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headstones we just obviously don't share enough didn to copy the design over to humans
347,i want my money back
348,no buyers remorse on this one
349,however been heads are currently not good for real time games like first-place shooters since the audio delay messes me up
350,the ear buds only play music in one ear
351,worst phone ever
352,poor voice clarity
353,it loosest connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two
354,terrible phone holder
355,the eyepiece on this is too large or too heavy it keeps falling out of my ear
356,don't buy it
357,really ugly
358,i used to talk on it for 1 1 1 2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying
359,having trouble with volume
360,also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cobra mph preferably ripped by windows media player
361,buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
362,how can that be the audio quality is poor
363,buttons are too small
364,save your money invest had this item for 11 months now
365,for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does
366,the charge arrived within the promised time but it did not work
367,same problem as others have mentioned
368,this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first
369,disappointed
370,if you hate ear avoid this phone by all means
371,another note about this phone appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model
372,i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort
373,then i had to continue pair it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
374,my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5 of 5
375,unfortunately it will not rechartering my ironed 402 despite connecting it from multiple power sources intimacy external battery wall outlet etc.
376,buy a different phone but not this
377,makes it easier to keep up with my blue when investigation not wearing it
378,i don't like this nooks either
379,customer service was terrible
380,i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more
381,you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
382,utter crap sound quality is terrible
383,poor quality
384,also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down
385,mice doesn't work
386,the no stated it my son was disappointed
387,i got this phone around the end of may and investigation completely unhappy with it
388,it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it
389,i bought this phone as a replacement for my start and have regretted it since
390,do not buy for deserves wrongly advertised for deserves
391,obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
392,there was so much hyped-up over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake
393,not nearly as good looking as the amazons picture makes it look
394,the buttons for on and off are bad
395,tree and two-mile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
396,as i said above pretty useless
397,the charge worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone
398,the plug did not work very well
399,however after about a year the flip started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls

787,the transition is user friendly and makes it easy tentative etc.
788,worked perfectly
789,linked to my phone without effort
790,a usable keyboard actually turns a pedal into a realtor useful machine instead of just a neat gadget

792,i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside
793,very pleased with this heads
794,very happy with this product
795,these are certainly very comfortable and functional is decent
796,good product good seller
797,these are fabulous
798,so far it has worked like a charm
799,nice heads priced right
800,i wish i could enter negative values admit
801,the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period
802,the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green-scaled work invest ever seen
803,now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant all-American propaganda
804,graphic is far from the best part of the game
805,it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90 mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere
806,again lame
807,glad i didn't pay to see it
808,but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u said
809,at around 4 pool-equipment i bought it at around 8 i started to watch at around 8 15 i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watch for a human being with a brain but there wasn't
810,exceptionally bad
811,but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance
812,but she is still a bad actress repeating her robot face moves in each of her pictures
813,at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like all-American
814,but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure
815,when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick
816,it's a mediocre miserable hollow laugh and predictable piece of garbage
817,the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pre-1960 film and make a complete non-service while changing its tone to a penetrated family movie
818,i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film
819,nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverses
820,to call this movie a drama is ridiculous
821,my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent micelle irons
822,regrettably the film fails
823,this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly
824,to sum the film up breed is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebony virus
825,won what a bad film
826,bel lug was totally extraneous into odd lines
827,that movie was bad
828,image ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these
829,that was done in the second movie
830,not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery
831,everything captain how says is either laugh or just plain stupid
832,in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all
833,wasted two hours
834,there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage judge's glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact judge's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene
835,every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show
836,the script is homogeneously stupid
837,one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gorge
838,i felt as though her going to island did absolutely nothing whatsoever
839,all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flaw at the core
840,there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place
841,final word this show is a real torture
842,lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing
843,the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing
844,a truly truly bad film
845,the directing seems too pretentious
846,but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculous of it
847,summary the wittingly weren't witty
848,avoid at any and all costs
849,the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underline the narrative
850,top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
851,i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
852,the football scenes at the end were perplexing
853,it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life
854,delegate this film from your mind
855,avoid this film at all costs
856,the only thing worse than taxpayer's acting was stock's singing
857,now this is a movie i really dislike
858,there are the usual hitch logic flaws
859,very bad performance plays angel better a computer expert who is at home all the time
860,yes i am simplify things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation
861,even the squire look awful
862,the script is was there a script
863,the character developments also lacked in depth
864,utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture
865,this movie is bad
866,ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch
867,how awful she is
868,it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying
869,the story is beyond stupid
870,the characters were very stage and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce
871,it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs
872,i was very disappointed in the movie
873,the visual effects were awful
874,all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money
875,end of days is one of the worst budget action movies invest ever seen
876,this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginals films i have ever seen in my entire life
877,1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10
878,the foreigner is not worth one second of your time
879,investigation translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 52-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence
880,not frightening in the least and barely comprehensive
881,it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason
882,the bimolecular of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a lui diapers commercial is completely unconvincing
883,there is no real plot
884,the story itself is just predictable and lazy
885,the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunder episode
886,there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters
887,i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie
888,the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense
889,a very very very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man
890,it is not good
891,the stories were as unbelievable as the actors
892,you'd have to have the iniquities of particularly stupid mollify not to see that one coming
893,if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded
894,i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season
895,the concert sequences just sucked
896,also the story and acting were weak
897,everything about this movie is stupid
898,i literally vomiting while watching this film
899,full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by eastward chore who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jeans needles from whom one would expect a great deal more
900,if this premise sound stupid that's because it is
901,the fat computer geese was unbelievable the bibles thumped the bass girl who are these actors
902,the awful dialogue and hopeless overactive by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time
903,but what really made it unchangeable was the direction
904,the film looks cheap and bland
905,i mean this in a terrible way
906,oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too
907,i was bored throughout the whole damn thing
908,this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way
909,in a word it is embarrassing
910,in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in lost angel is nothing but nonsense
911,the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
912,i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way
913,and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode
914,i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by stride cords of music that would blared out with very little warning and even less meaning
915,victor musclemen was even bad and brilliant don was almost unrecognizable
916,these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotype and with no depth of imagination
917,it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if it'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap
918,avoid at all costs
919,what on earth is irons doing in this film
920,whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me
921,i couldn't take them seriously
922,about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly bubbling overweight pseudo-symmetric gibbet corny enough to make a teen got blush almost always in older enlist and sometimes in lactating that may or may not be made up words
923,horrible
924,the directing is sloppy at best
925,there was no chemistry between been aleck and sand bull in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by
926,if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
927,and finally after all that we get to an ending that would been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerk fall
928,too politically correct
929,i wasn't expecting oxcart material but this
930,rating 0 10 grade zombies note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show
931,the jerky camera movements were also annoying
932,a bit predictable
933,very serious spoiled this movie was a huge disappointment
934,crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racists and prejudice are bad things
935,i wasn't the least bit interested
936,the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film
937,i just got bored watching juices lange take her clothes off
938,from here on the wide character turns unintentionally comically
939,this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed
940,the film lacks any real scare or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit if to say the least i say that as an insulin dependent diabetic myself
941,highly unredeemed
942,let's start with all the problems the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad
943,it's an empty hollow shell of a movie
944,filming was less expansive
945,investigation so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone
946,watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show
947,the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest
948,investigation glad this pretentious piece of said didn't do as planned by the dodge stratum big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of quo
949,there was nothing believable about it at all
950,i never walked out of a movie faster
951,he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screen of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money
952,by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it
953,i know that jig orthicon was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but gorge was well dull
954,you can find better movies at youth
955,there is no plot or storyline
956,how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc. it's all wrong
957,this is definitely one of the bad ones
958,yeah the movie pretty much sucked
959,the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling
960,lewd black considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiaries when he is untrained which the pre-1960 rating certainly won't allow
961,never heard of any of them except cooled who was totally unbelievable in the part
962,his co-star don't fare much better with people like morgen freeman journal hill and ed. helm just wasted
963,this one just fails to create any real suspense
964,unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict
965,this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 700 times
966,an hour and a half i wish i could bring back
967,considering the relations off screen between tailor and stand it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them
968,the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is
969,one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a charcoal
970,there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomiting
971,the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful
972,another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would sped forth soon after
973,it's a case of so bad it is laugh
974,this movie is so mending awful it couldn't have even been created
975,aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debts
976,i can't believe there's even a sequel to this
977,so bad well it's just bad
978,this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 198 deep impact and aged and this one fails everywhere
979,only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hum
980,the poor actors
981,then the film just dropped the ball
982,but even the talented care can't save this
983,i am not a film nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if it'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie
984,the least said about the acting the better
985,at any rate this film stink its not funny and full should have stayed with gallon and supernatural zombie movies
986,worse there's an incredibly weak sub thrown in that follows a little band of latter manifested as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killing
987,i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it
988,even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep
989,hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing
990,it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original
991,the only place good for this film is in the garbage
992,that's how it'd describe this painfully dreary time-cast of a film
993,the charge opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsomal sideshow for god sake
994,the lead man is charisma
995,things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it
996,it will drive you barking mad
997,it is shameful
998,it's a shame to see good actors like thermometers and jam make a living in a mess like this
999,i thought it was bad
1000,nothing new there
1001,i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad
1002,in fact this stink smells like a director release
1003,but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom
1004,first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone
1005,i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief
1006,he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else
1007,almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful
1008,there were too many close ups
1009,regardless the film fails on most levels
1010,on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen
1011,you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them
1012,image big fan of rpm games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self-respect rigger there is
1013,the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overactive and underbracing
1014,this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here
1015,the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror
1016,i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover
1017,the puppets look really cheese not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks
1018,often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings
1019,the basic premise is wasted since it is sideline by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
1020,the acting was bad the dialogue were extremely shallow and insincere
1021,it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see
1022,if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative
1023,this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie-goer public
1024,i hate movies like that
1025,he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedie timing
1026,even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miseries this is bad
1027,what the hell kind of crap is that
1028,i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribbled watched it before putting it on
1029,started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters
1030,the use of slow-moving needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a director style that bordered on stupidity
1031,it's very slow
1032,1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking
1033,all in all a great disappointment
1034,the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rite hay is put up on a pedestal
1035,so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forget movies invest seen
1036,this was one of the worst films i have ever seen
1037,very little music or anything to speak of
1038,the show would begin with smart ass ed. comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
1039,which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review
1040,it was too predictable even for a chick flick
1041,i know he was a contract player with little control over his script but the acting was as bad as the script
1042,it's like a bad two hour tva movie
1043,but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn
1044,both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watch
1045,star trek voters the final frontier is the worst in the series
1046,again no plot at all
1047,i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie
1048,not recommended
1049,artless camera endlessly presents us with the uglier setting imaginary i e
1050,trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watch like character story theme and so on
1051,a cheap and cheer heisted movie with poor characterization lots of underwrite style stoicism emotion think chow yuh fat in a better tomorrow and some cheese cliche thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judge rolls a la john woo
1052,the film has an ultra-fast look to it
1053,it just blew
1054,there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible
1055,i would see this movie again for free
1056,almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round
1057,none of them are engaging or exciting
1058,the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peacemaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a column movie before
1059,of course the acting is blame
1060,lots of holes in the script
1061,it'll even say it again this is torture
1062,you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action
1063,the dialogue sucked
1064,very disappointing
1065,the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right
1066,why was this film made
1067,not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and genera but it also managed to give away the entire movie and investigation not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer
1068,this movie is terrible
1069,not recommended
1070,the flat re-enactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stag
1071,20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausibly uninitiated bore of a movie
1072,which has more depth and character than the man underneath it
1073,i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie
1074,if you check the director's film on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance
1075,the movie is littered with overt racial slurped towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as moons and booboo
1076,don't waste your time
1077,the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed
1078,what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in lost angel
1079,the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is minifying
1080,i don't think invest ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much
1081,my rating just 3 out of 10
1082,deep spider just plain suck
1083,the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dose bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcanized stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhhu does a belly dance to distract male guards
1084,there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot
1085,hated it
1086,the death row scenes were entirely unmoved
1087,but this movie is definitely a below average rent
1088,so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumb thing you have never seen
1089,even bill booboo couldn't rise above the script which was worse
1090,rating 1 out of 10
1091,it is indescribable the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen
1092,he really didn't seem to want to be hostile his voice were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests
1093,by the time the pyrometer waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off
1094,this may be the only bad film he ever made
1095,with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer
1096,it was forced like everything in this movie
1097,i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake
1098,in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film
1099,worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh
1100,the plot well i said it'd let that one go
1101,everything about it is just bad
1102,nothing at all to recommend
1103,didn't laugh or even smile once
1104,really bad
1105,not easy to watch
1106,this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life
1107,a lass movie which should have been put to sleep forever
1108,so bad
1109,lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age
1110,otherwise don't even waste your time on this
1111,but the acting even that of such professionals as dragon and debt rock was terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialogue childlike and the camera work barely tolerable
1112,unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad
1113,if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girl-friend boy-furiendo to keep you occupied through out
1114,his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausibly and unconvincing
1115,this was a flick doomed from its conception
1116,i paid too much
1117,this is one of the worst sand bull movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad
1118,if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible
1119,it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film
1120,is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this
1121,investigation terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there
1122,the acting is terrible and the writing is worse
1123,i am so tired of cliche that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
1124,this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living working in a chilly abstrusenesses culture
1125,lame would be the best way to describe it
1126,it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meandered so badly
1127,i don't think invest ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgence piece of junk
1128,today the graphic are crap
1129,the worst sapping dialogue i could go on and on
1130,the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy
1131,about half way through this film i started to dislike it
1132,director pause math who also wrote directed the weak 195 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films
1133,seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on
1134,and the accents are absolutely abysmal
1135,now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong
1136,sadder has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films
1137,the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good
1138,it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes
1139,long whinny and pointless
1140,investigation not sure what he was trying to do with this film
1141,omit watching this
1142,this is not money-making
1143,the dialogue is atrociously
1144,it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcase his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy
1145,to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things
1146,putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy lattice character
1147,the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mysticisms fodder
1148,the budget was evidently very limited
1149,as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening
1150,whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely
1151,then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who false was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid
1152,overall this movie was cheap trash
1153,invest seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie
1154,but it's just not funny
1155,i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic
1156,the malt settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue
1157,i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs
1158,won talk about awful
1159,all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slack make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes
1160,the story line is totally predictable
1161,your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation
1162,it was so boring
1163,very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oxcart shortly
1164,there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciating slow moving
1165,the plot has more holes than a pair of fish stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted
1166,but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies
1167,the script is bad very bad it contains both chess and unmethodical joke that you normally see in rated r or nonce movie
1168,this would not even be good as a made for tva flick
1169,the chromatography it can be called tucked
1170,this scene is very strong and unpleasant
1171,speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchen
1172,hence the whole story lacks a certain energy
1173,the script is a big flaw mess
1174,unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austere work you can skip this one
1175,characters are one-time even the good guys and especially the bad guys
1176,it was just too horrible
1177,the lighting is awful
1178,not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out
1179,even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie
1180,her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
1181,investigation still trying to get over how bad it was
1182,camera again bad
1183,about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts
1184,bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad
1185,and quite honestly often its not very good
1186,it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time
1187,there is a totally unnecessary train roller coasted scene
1188,the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty
1189,attempting artfulness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent
1190,it is zorrillas times away from reality
1191,this show is made for all-American it is too stupid and full with hatred and cliche to be admitted elsewhere
1192,i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
1193,but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a meddle and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap
1194,the movie seemed a little slow at first
1195,it was housework
1196,the sound-truck sucked
1197,this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding
1198,the results well are a shame
1199,everything stink
1200,it is an insane game
1201,now you know why i gave it a 10
1202,in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films
1203,punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema
1204,this is high adventure at its best
1205,okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so it'll give credit where credit due the creature effects were actually pretty cool
1206,if you do watch it however there are small consolation the actresses playing anyone's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles
1207,kiss kerosene is good in this movie and really makes a difference
1208,the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end
1209,everything from acting to chromatography was solid
1210,the film's sole bright spot was journal hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superb due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim
1211,go and see it
1212,i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south allegorical understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process
1213,it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts
1214,i saw it as a child on tva back in 1970 when it was the stranger and i loved it
1215,i rate this movie 9 10
1216,the best scene in the movie was when garage is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head
1217,i guess i liked the details of his distinction he was believable
1218,plus it was well-braced and suited its relatively short run time
1219,yet i enjoy watching it
1220,it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tva never mind the fact that i already have it memorized
1221,gotta love those close-up of slim drooping teeth
1222,my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robber ran portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed
1223,an instant classic with a great sound-truck and a catchy song during the ending credits
1224,mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasy that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line
1225,i saw this film over christened and what a great film it was
1226,if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirt joblessness rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplift ending give this one a try
1227,still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my over scale
1228,funny clever hip just like pray previous film hyped-up
1229,this is the kind of money that is wasted properly
1230,the camera really likes her in this movie
1231,it's hard not to fall head-on in love with that girl
1232,the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to primary
1233,predictable but not a bad watch
1234,the result is a power achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame
1235,the movie is not completely perfect but titter di glamorous will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie
1236,i struggle to find anything bad to say about it
1237,the writer germane beard undoubtedly did his housework because all references are industry and character appropriate
1238,hopefully the director jam con can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film
1239,the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night
1240,this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it
1241,despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie
1242,however pause sadder has indeed made a film about mishap that is both superb complex
1243,but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold
1244,but it is entertaining nonetheless
1245,stevedore martini delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged upper class upright white guy
1246,the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip
1247,how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this
1248,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it
1249,if there was ever a movie that needed worn-out to promote this is it
1250,you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars
1251,the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries invest seen
1252,lovely little thrillers from hitch with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxis

1553,call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever
1554,via shillings did an excellent job with the script
1555,but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr

1570,there are some generally great things in it
1571,he owns the film just as space owned coal miner daughter and quaint owned great balls of fire
1572,for that it's worth checking out
1573,it's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of fault masterpieces
1574,though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sea coroner's noble brigade candidacy bergs fist heroine john hustle wily john hay or stevedore kale specify radiant ruthless candor lieutenant rose big stick
1575,i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works

1595,lange had become a great actress
1596,i would have caste her in that role after ready the script
1597,i rather enjoyed it
1598,i really liked that
1599,it is rare when a film takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent
1600,highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron
1601,the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trip but i wouldn't eat here again
1602,overall i wasn't very impressed with no
1603,took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was lukewarm warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed
1604,avoid at all cost
1605,the chicken wings contained the dries chicken meat i have ever eaten
1606,the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a dour indoor garden for tea and biscuits
1607,i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
1608,we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left
1609,any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one
1610,don go here
1611,the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people serve so the food was coming in a slow pace
1612,please stay away from the shrimp stir fried nodules
1613,costing that came with the salad was stale
1614,will not be back
1615,if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it
1616,i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location
1617,how can you call yourself a steak if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand
1618,it was a drive to get there
1619,never going back
1620,we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chew
1621,the food was terrible
1622,won't go back
1623,it'd rather eat airline food seriously
1624,i think not again
1625,the selection was probably the worst invest seen in vinegar there was none
1626,would not go back
1627,insults profound debauchery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidifies it
1628,host staff were for lack of a better word bitch
1629,as much as it'd like to go back i can't get passed the atrociously service and will never return
1630,total brunches fail
1631,unfortunately it only set us up for disappointment with our entries
1632,the food is about on par with deny which is to say not good at all
1633,i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone
1634,your serve suck wait correction our serve herein sucked
1635,horrible don't waste your time and money
1636,not good for the money
1637,i don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving
1638,i won't try going back there even if it's empty
1639,it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor
1640,when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing
1641,the scallops dish is quite appalling for value as well
1642,we'll never go again
1643,over rated
1644,my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything
1645,then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
1646,for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed
1647,but then they came back cold
1648,the live music on frigid totally blows
1649,drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point
1650,very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay platter
1651,the descriptions said yuh yuh sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayor well none of the rolls had sauces on them
1652,before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at brachii burgeoned before writing a review
1653,we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant
1654,i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of firebug behind the bar
1655,the buffet at bell was far from what i anticipated
1656,i just wanted to leave
1657,she ordered a toasted enlist muffins that came out unassisted
1658,we won't be going back anytime soon
1659,invest never been treated so bad
1660,anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more
1661,investigation not eating here
1662,i ordered almonds soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meals
1663,the burgeoned had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burgeoned was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor
1664,by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known
1665,there is really nothing for me at post hope your experience is better
1666,i give it 2 thumbs down
1667,hell no will i go back
1668,i had high hopes for this place since the burners are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat
1669,for service i give them no stars
1670,the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says his for the first 10 minutes
1671,we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed
1672,gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore
1673,ordered burgeoned rare came in we'll done
1674,this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our food and they kept forgetting things
1675,i was very disappointed
1676,we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste
1677,i can take a little bad service but the food suck
1678,as for the mains also uninjured
1679,my sash was poor quality being soggy and tasteless
1680,thoroughly disappointed
1681,i had the ma salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again
1682,as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means
1683,the cashews cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undertook
1684,i will not be eating there again
1685,there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again
1686,now the burners aren't as good the pizza which used to be amazing is dough and flavor
1687,just don't know why they were so slow
1688,your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me
1689,did not like at all
1690,the selection of food was not the best
1691,this one is simply a disappointment
1692,say bye bye to your tip lady
1693,the place was not clean and the food oh so stale
1694,2 times very bad customer service
1695,it was way over fried
1696,a fly was in my apple juice a fly
1697,spend your money elsewhere
1698,they never brought a salad we asked for
1699,i as well would given grandfathers zero stars if possible
1700,very tough and very short on flavor
1701,the warm beer didn't help
1702,friend's past also bad he barely touched it
1703,invest had better baggage from the grocery store
1704,this is a disgrace
1705,the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some car in your stomach
1706,soggy and not good
1707,by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse
1708,i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself
1709,i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food
1710,we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them
1711,i can't tell you how disappointed i was
1712,weird vibes from owners
1713,will not be back
1714,disappointing experience
1715,now i am getting angry and i want my damn phone
1716,the service was not up to par either
1717,the sang was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous
1718,there is nothing authentic about this place
1719,eel this location needs a complete overhaul
1720,i started this review with two stars but investigation editing it to give it only one
1721,on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
1722,hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempo i watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloves everything is deep fried in oil
1723,do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish
1724,if you look for authentic that food go else where
1725,i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives
1726,but now i was completely gross out
1727,i hate to disagree with my fellow yelped but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place
1728,we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting
1729,too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place
1730,the heart attack grill in downtown vinegar is an absolutely flat-bed excuse for a restaurant
1731,the burr blame
1732,the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer
1733,the service here leaves a lot to be desired
1734,this place is horrible and way overpriced
1735,perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but investigation not inspired to go back
1736,it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
1737,the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugar disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old
1738,why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked
1739,it was not good
1740,no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it
1741,this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant
1742,it was a huge awkward 1 50 piece of cow that was 3 4th grist and fat
1743,i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair
1744,the service was terrible though
1745,service was slow and not attentive
1746,my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too
1747,the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12
1748,the kids play area is nasty
1749,probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it
1750,not tasty and the texture was just nasty
1751,i vomiting in the bathroom mid lunch
1752,if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars
1753,do not waste your money here
1754,like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again
1755,seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crabs legs but the crabs legs definitely did not taste fresh
1756,boy was that suckers dry
1757,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating
1758,i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed
1759,this place deserves no stars
1760,on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared better-than-average pile of green bird pop
1761,worst food service invest had in a while
1762,we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either
1763,it was equally awful
1764,after all the ravenous reviews i couldn't wait to eat here what a disappointment
1765,ordered a double cheese got a single patted that was falling apart picture unloaded yeah still suck
1766,a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad
1767,waited 2 hours never got either of our pizza as many other around us who came in later did
1768,it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign
1769,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides cost
1770,i probably won't be coming back here
1771,terrible management
1772,seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
1773,my gyro was basically letter only
1774,i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly
1775,ordered an appetizing and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes
1776,i took back my money and got outta there
1777,waiter was a jerk
1778,i wasn't really impressed with strip steak
1779,it was extremely crumbly and pretty tasteless
1780,then our food came out disappointment ensued
1781,frozen puckish of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register
1782,poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table
1783,also the friezes are without a doubt the worst friezes invest ever had
1784,worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries
1785,invest lived here since 1970 and this was the first and last time invest stepped foot into this place
1786,pricing is a bit of a concern at mellowed mushroom
1787,i find wasting food to be desirable but this just wasn't food
1788,i got home to see the dries damn wings ever
1789,i would not recommend this place
1790,the friezes were not hot and neither was my burgeoned
1791,if you are reading this please don't go there
1792,the chicken dishes are oks the beef is like shoe leather
1793,not even a hello we will be right with you
1794,first time there and might just be the last
1795,appetite instantly gone
1796,the service here is fair at best
1797,this place is overpriced not consistent with their booboo and it really is overpriced
1798,it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it
1799,i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore
1800,won't ever go here again
1801,the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad
1802,the service was poor and that being nice
1803,this place should honestly be blown up
1804,the service was me
1805,the cash had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being way overpriced
1806,i waited and waited
1807,the fried rice was dry as well
1808,this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food
1809,we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything
1810,my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service
1811,at least 40 passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasn't that busy
1812,this place is disgusting
1813,we started with the tune sash which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh
1814,sadly gone ram steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vinegar
1815,will never ever go back
1816,i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible
1817,must have been an off night at this place
1818,the chip ranch dipping sausage was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat
1819,strike 2 who wants to be rushed
1820,i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list
1821,they dropped more than the ball
1822,i came back today since they related and still not impressed
1823,the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever
1824,the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us
1825,worst martini ever
1826,never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again
1827,overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too
1828,there is nothing privileged about working eating there
1829,which are small and not worth the price
1830,avoid this establishment
1831,bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing it'll leave it at that
1832,and the beans and rice were mediocre at best
1833,after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods
1834,we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get it definitely lost the love after this one
1835,definitely not worth the 3 i paid
1836,i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful
1837,for about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon
1838,not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed
1839,probably not in a hurry to go back
1840,it was probably dirt
1841,waited and waited and waited
1842,the serve was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place
1843,terrible service
1844,i wouldn't return
1845,best of luck to the rude and non-com service focused new management
1846,i don't think it'll be running back to car's anytime soon for food
1847,it's too bad the food is so damn genera
1848,this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food
1849,not good by any stretch of the imagination
1850,the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see
1851,in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience
1852,very slow at seating even with reservation
1853,not much seafood and like 5 strings of past at the bottom
1854,the burgeoned i got the gold standard a 17 burgeoned and was kind of disappointed
1855,the worst experience ever
1856,we could not believe how dirty the oysters were
1857,she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door
1858,it was packed
1859,i do love sushi but i found killable to be overpriced over- and undeserved
1860,if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again
1861,the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tender very unsatisfactory
1862,real sushi lovers let's be honest ya is not that good
1863,i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed
1864,definitely a turn off for me i doubt it'll be back unless someone else is buying
1865,we will not be coming back
1866,we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived
1867,my girl-friend veal was very bad
1868,investigation probably one of the few people to ever go to insane and not like it
1869,mediocre food
1870,we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well
1871,way over rated is all i am saying
1872,hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were gross out by the melted styrene and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick
1873,the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
1874,my friend did not like his bloody marry
1875,the service was a bit lacking
1876,a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait
1877,similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late
1878,we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us
1879,i just don't know how this place managed to served the bland food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indignant cuisine
1880,we won't be going back
1881,he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vinegar
1882,we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home
1883,the service was terrible food was mediocre
1884,don't bother coming here
1885,unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on left day because everything we ordered was stale
1886,third the cheese on my friend's burgeoned was cold
1887,the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the serve to bring it out to us
1888,the serve went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped
1889,the serve are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons
1890,based on the subparts service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back
1891,the worst was the salmon sash
1892,would not recommend to others
1893,don't do it
1894,it sure does beat the natch at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant
1895,investigation not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place
1896,what did bother me was the slow service
1897,i felt insulted and disrespect how could you talk and judge another human being like that
1898,i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only
1899,not my thing
1900,this place lacked style
1901,i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day
1902,service suck
1903,i had the chicken phone and it tasted very bland
1904,nothing special
1905,the refreshed beans that came with my meal were dried out and crust and the food was bland
1906,the chains which investigation no fan of beat this place easily
1907,for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food
1908,overpriced for what you are getting
1909,spend your money and time some place else
1910,i probably won't be back to be honest
1911,it'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere
1912,the presentation of the food was awful
1913,first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucca
1914,overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bourbon
1915,i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mileage
1916,tasted like dirt
1917,hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in
1918,i go to far too many places and invest never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 4 0600
1919,it kept getting worse and worse so now investigation officially done
1920,i don't think we'll be going back anytime soon
1921,i would not recommend this place
1922,my fella got the hue rancher and they didn't look too appealing
1923,shrimp when i upped it i live only 1 2 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold
1924,total waste of time
1925,i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the ex-liberals but i didn't use my common sense
1926,i will not return
1927,however there was so much garlic in the fond it was barely edible
1928,worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of me bunch of horrible name calling
1929,it was pretty gross
1930,sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon
1931,although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing
1932,the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it
1933,very poor service
1934,the management is rude
1935,paying 7 85 for a hot dog and friezes that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wieners is not my idea of a good meal
1936,bland and flavor is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
1937,i have been in more than a few bars in vinegar and do not ever recall being charged for tap water
1938,main thing i didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30 and up
1939,the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible
1940,i won't be back
1941,the real disappointment was our waiter
1942,i was so insulted
1943,what happened next was pretty off putting
1944,service stink here
1945,tonight i had the elk filets special and it sucked
1946,the bus boy on the other hand was so rude
1947,i probably would not go here again
1948,the rid style camaraderie was a joke
1949,if someone orders two tact don't you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or alas cart
1950,my order was not correct
1951,the pizza tasted old super chew in not a good way
1952,food is way overpriced and portions are fuck small
1953,the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless
1954,it wasn't busy at all and now we know why
1955,and the red curry had so much boo shots and wasn't very tasty to me
1956,i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch
1957,furthermore you can't even find hours of operation on the web
1958,i dressed up to be treated so rudely
1959,i consider this theft
1960,investigation not impressed with the concept or the food
1961,rifleman's bar is definitely one editing establishment i won't be revising
1962,don't waste your time here
1963,despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star
1964,i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack
1965,rude inconsiderable management
1966,the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisker and pulled pork
1967,after two i felt disgusting
1968,food was below average
1969,very very sad
1970,con spotty service
1971,needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon
1972,will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened
1973,it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold
1974,tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse
1975,the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow
1976,overall i was not impressed and would not go back
1977,for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone
1978,so don't go there if you are looking for good food
1979,the ambiance isn't much better
1980,the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either
1981,bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise
1982,i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor
1983,i was modified
1984,the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined
1985,after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert
1986,not a single employee came out to see if we were oks or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food
1987,del tact is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
1988,we waited for forty five minutes in vain
1989,investigation super piss
